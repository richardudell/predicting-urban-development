    "# Google Earth Engine Python (GEE) API Tutorial\n",
    "By: Richard Udell\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is presented as a walk-through of an analysis: **Identifying Urban Trend Surrounding Denver International Airport (DIA) From 1995 to 2012**.  \n",
    "# Goal\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to introduce new Python users to a seemingly complex combination of tools - Google Earth Engine, Jupyter Notebook, and the Python programming language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What has kept me motivated throughout the development of this tutorial?\n",
    "I am a new Python user and an even newer GEE user and I have overcome **some** of the challenges of using the Google Earth Engine Python API in Jupyter Notebooks and I want to make it easier for the next user.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Relevance\n",
    "As the name implies, the Google Earth Engine Python API combines two tools: Python and Google Earth Engine.  Google Earth Engine has an [easy-to-use online code editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com) that includes the documentation and a [GEE guide](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine#background) that is very helpful for new-users.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are two problems for users of the GEE Python API:\n",
    "1. The GEE documentation and the GEE guide are in JavaScript\n",
    "2. There are few resources for users that choose to run the GEE Python API on their own Python environment inside Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why to use the Google Earth Engine Python API?\n",
    "The Python programming language is [very popular for good reasons](https://www.python.org/about/) and has an active open-source community that actively maintains many powerful packages for data-analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Earth Engine is a very powerful tool for two reasons: \n",
    "1. GEE provides easy access to very large spatial datasets from organizations all over the world via the [Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) without ever having to store them locally on your computer - many of these spatial datasets are much larger than your computers hard drive.  \n",
    "2. GEE provides access to a much more powerful computer.  Some of the calculations that you will perform in GEE would take days to do on your computer’s processor, but GEE servers will do the calculations for you and return the results in seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of Google Earth Engine and Python can increase the efficiency, reach, and speed of very large-scale (I'm talking pedabytes!) spatial data-analysis.  "

    "The yellow pixels corresond to areas in the ROI that havea  positive urban trend.  If you turn off the 'Linear_Fit' layer, the basemap reveals high quality imagery of the land as it appears today, in 2020.  Comparing the areas in yellow, that are calculated to have had a positive urban trend in 2012, to the basemap, it appears that the yellow areas align with neighborhoods that exist today.  However, there are few areas of the map that are extensively in yellow.  On the other hand, the majority of the map marked as having a negative urban trend (light blue).  "

    "# Results/Conclusions of Analysis\n",
    "In order to interpret the results of the linear fit model, I have exported the model form GEE (as a .TIF file) then re-imported the model into a numpy array.  The linear fit model is interpreted in the code cells below to determine that 13% of the pixels in the ROI have a positive urban trend.  This means that the urban fraction at each of those pixels has increased throughout the temporal range of the analysis (1995 to 2012). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusions of Tutorial\n",
    "The primary limitation for a new user to the Google Earth Engine Python API is that the GEE documentation and guide are in JavaScript.  I believe that it is imperative that new users learn to read JavaScript because the guide is a very useful resource.  However, I do not believe that this is a large limitation because JavaScript and Python are very similar languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also clear that using using the GEE Python API in Jupyter Notebooks would be much more difficult without the use of geemap. "

    "# Implications/Next Steps\n",
    "This tutorial stands to prove that the Google Earth Engine API can run effectively in Jupyter Notebooks.  Moving forward, I would like to expand the temporal range of the analysis to 2020.  This would increase the relevance of the identification of urban trend.  However, this would require the addition of Landsat 8 imagery to the workflow and likely the calculation of new endmembers for spectral unmixing.  Additionally, I would like to expand the linear analysis to include a linear regression model that could predict future urban development in the land surrounding DIA."
