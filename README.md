# Predicting Urban Development

This project uses the Google Earth Engine Python API to identify trends in development surrounding Denver International Airport (DIA) from time-series Landsat imagery.  The package [geemap](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap) is used to visualize map layers.  This repository was initially created as Richard Udellâ€™s final project for the Earth Data Analytics Professional Certificate from the Earth Lab at University of Colorado - Boulder.

It is clear to any observer that a large amount of development has occurred around the Denver International Airport since its completion of construction in 1995.  Since the Denver International Airport was the last major airport constructed in the United States (no major airport has been constructed since 1995), understanding the impact DIA had on the development of the surrounding region is of interest to more than just policy makers, business owners, and citizens in the Denver Metro Area.  The goal of this project is develop a model that can predict future development.

Installation instructions can be found at the following links:
* Google Earth Engine API | https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/python_install  |
    * A [Google Earth Engine account](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/) is necessary to use the Google Earth Engine API (a university email address may be accepted more quickly).


* geemap |  https://github.com/giswqs/geemap |  




Google Earth Engine is a powerful tool, however, fewer workflows involve the the python API than the built-in [JavaScript API](https://code.earthengine.google.com).  Additionally, the geemap package was first released in March 2020.  With proper installation of these packages, the workflow can be run in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) - workflow is contained in one script.
